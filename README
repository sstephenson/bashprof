bashprof: Bash profiler
=======================

This is a work in progress! Only works on Mac OS X right now.

Check out bashprof:
$ git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/bashprof.git

Build the loadable module:
$ make -C src

Run bashprof with the program you want to profile:
$ bin/bashprof <command to profile> [<arg> ...]

The bashprof command injects a stub bash executable into your path and
execs the command you pass. Any Bash scripts executed by the given
command will be profiled, so long as they have a `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
shebang line.

Formatted profile results are written to stderr.
